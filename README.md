# Pandas-challenge

This challenge asks for an analysis of PyCity Schools.

# Analysis
A trend formed when looking at larger schools with bigger student budgets. The schools with more per student spending had lower average scores and very different overall passing scores. This doesnt lend to logic as higher investment commanly creates results. 
 
Using this unexpected yield taking we take a deeper look into another defining metric. Some schools are completely public or, "district", while others are charter and exist outside the confines of state school districts. The top 5 schools in each category were all charter schools. Suggesting that the difference in curriculum, coupled with selective rosters, cultivates higher scores. This is further supported by the bottom schools all being district. Even the large charter performed on par with the other despite having a larger student body. 

Smaller schools had better scores. Though no data was presented showing smaller district school. This information could help solifify assertions about school size and grades.

If public schools adopted some of the systems of charter schools they may be able to raise average scores. As well as lowering the cost per student. Which was lower for charters.

This could save a lot of money for school systems.
